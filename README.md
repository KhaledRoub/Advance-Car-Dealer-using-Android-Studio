# **Advance Car Dealer App**

**Project Description:** 
A car dealer has requested you to develop an Android application that enables users to conveniently view and reserve cars either online or through a local database. The application should be user-friendly and simple in design. The required functionalities include:

## **1- Introduction Layout**
   This layout features a 'Connect' button designed to establish a connection to a server using REST to load all car types into an ArrayList.
   - If the connection is successful, proceed to the login and registration section.
   - If the connection is unsuccessful, display an error message and remain on the same layout.

## **2- Login and Registration Layout**

   This layout should include a "Login" button and a "Sign Up" button.
    
   - **Login:** Users can enter their email and password, which are registered in the database. If the credentials match, they can log in.
   - **Sign-Up:** New users can register with their email, providing various details as outlined in the sign-up page.

   The following image shows how the data should look in the mock API. If the mock API is down, try uploading the data from 'data.json' to it.
